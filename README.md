--Business Problem

The goal of this project is to analyze the resale market for Singapore's public housing in order to provide valuable insights for understanding market trends and making data-driven decisions.

--Sample Questions

What are the trends in resale prices across different flat types and locations?
How do premium properties compare to standard properties in terms of value and market behavior?
What are the average resale prices in Bukit Merah compared to other towns?
Which factors most influence the pricing of public housing in Singapore?
How does the remaining lease of a flat affect its resale price?
What financial considerations should buyers be aware of when purchasing flats in different areas?

--Data Cleaning

Handled missing values in columns such as flat model and resale price.
Standardized date formats and lease details for consistency.
Unified flat type and town name categories to remove inconsistencies.
Filtered out properties with incomplete or extreme outlier data points.
Ensured data accuracy by verifying the consistency of numerical columns (e.g., floor area, resale price).

--Data Processing

Created new categories for flat types (e.g., Premium, Standard) based on resale value thresholds.
Extracted year and month from the transaction date to facilitate time-based analysis.
Computed additional metrics, such as price per square meter and lease duration in years.
Segmented the data into location-specific subsets to enable town-based analysis.
Highlighted calculated columns for clarity and transparency.

--Data Analysis and Interactive Dashboard

Used pivot tables to generate various visualizations, such as trend analysis charts and category comparisons.
Created interactive charts to explore price trends by town, flat type, and lease duration.
